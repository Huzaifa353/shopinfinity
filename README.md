E-Commerce Website

#### Background

It's a standalone and reliable software which does not depend on the availability
of other softwares. It's supported on every web-browser.

#### Software Interfaces
The software is developed on:

Frontend: HTML, LESS/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

Backend: MYSQL, XAMPP(Server), PHP.

Any operating systems will work fine.
